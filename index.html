            Addendum: This game was created with a focus on clean styling,
            efficient event handling using event delegation, and a
            straightforward win-checking mechanism. The use of a separate CSS
            class for styling enhances modularity and code maintainability. The
            optional embellishments, including a timer and reset button,
            contribute to an enhanced user experience.

            Technologies used include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The styling is
            achieved with CSS Grid for the game board layout, and JavaScript
            handles the game logic. The use of event delegation ensures
            efficient event handling, especially for larger boards. The timer
            functionality is implemented with JavaScript's setInterval. This
            project demonstrates a combination of front-end technologies to
            create an interactive and visually appealing game.
